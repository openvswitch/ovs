.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovsdb\-server\fR program provides RPC interfaces to one or more
Open vSwitch databases (OVSDBs).  It supports JSON-RPC client
connections over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.
.PP
Each OVSDB file may be specified on the command line as \fIdatabase\fR.
If none is specified, the default is \fB@DBDIR@/conf.db\fR.  The database
files must already have been created and initialized using, for
example, \fBovsdb\-tool create\fR.
.
.SH "ACTIVE and BACKUP"
\fBovsdb\-server\fR runs either as a backup server, or as an active server.
When  \fBovsdb\-server\fR is running as a backup server, all transactions that
can modify the database content, including the lock commands are rejected.
Active server, on the other hand, accepts all ovsdb server transactions.
When \fBovsdb\-server\fR role changes, all existing client connection are
reset, requiring clients to reconnect to the server.
.PP
By default, \fBovsdb\-server\fR runs as an active server, except when the
\fB\-\-sync\-from=\fIserver\fR command line option is specified and without
the \fB\-\-no\-sync option\fR.  During runtime, \fBovsdb\-server\fR role can be switch by using appctl commands.
.PP
\fBovsdb-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR switches
\fBovsdb\-server\fR into a backup server, Conversely,
\fBovsdb-server/disconnect\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR switches server into
an active one.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "\fB\-\-remote=\fIremote\fR"
Adds \fIremote\fR as a connection method used by \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
\fIremote\fR must take one of the following forms:
.
.RS
.so ovsdb/remote-passive.man
.so ovsdb/remote-active.man
.
.IP "\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR"
Reads additional connection methods from \fIcolumn\fR in all of the
rows in \fItable\fR within \fIdb\fR.  As the contents of \fIcolumn\fR changes,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR also adds and drops connection methods accordingly.
.IP
If \fIcolumn\fR's type is string or set of strings, then the
connection methods are taken directly from the column.  The connection
methods in the column must have one of the forms described above.
.IP
If \fIcolumn\fR's type is UUID or set of UUIDs and references a table,
then each UUID is looked up in the referenced table to obtain a row.
The following columns in the row, if present and of the correct type,
configure a connection method.  Any additional columns are ignored.
.RS
.IP "\fBtarget\fR (string)"
Connection method, in one of the forms described above.  This column
is mandatory: if it is missing or empty then no connection method can
be configured.
.IP "\fBmax_backoff\fR (integer)"
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection attempts.
.IP "\fBinactivity_probe\fR (integer)"
Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to
client before sending an inactivity probe message.
.IP "\fBread_only\fR (boolean)"
If true, only read-only transactions are allowed on this connection.
.RE
.IP
It is an error for \fIcolumn\fR to have another type.
.RE
.
.IP
To connect or listen on multiple connection methods, use multiple
\fB\-\-remote\fR options.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-run=\fIcommand\fR]"
Ordinarily \fBovsdb\-server\fR runs forever, or until it is told to
exit (see \fBRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\fR below).  With this option,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR instead starts a shell subprocess running
\fIcommand\fR.  When the subprocess terminates, \fBovsdb\-server\fR
also exits gracefully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit
code 0, then \fBovsdb\-server\fR exits with exit code 0 also;
otherwise, it exits with exit code 1.
.IP
This option can be useful where a database server is needed only to
run a single command, e.g.:
.B "ovsdb\-server \-\-remote=punix:socket \-\-run='ovsdb\-client dump unix:socket Open_vSwitch'"
.IP
This option is not supported on Windows platform.
.SS "Daemon Options"

.SS "Public Key Infrastructure Options"
The options described below for configuring the SSL public key
infrastructure accept a special syntax for obtaining their
configuration from the database.  If any of these options is given
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR as its argument, then the
actual file name is read from the specified \fIcolumn\fR in \fItable\fR
within the \fIdb\fR database.  The \fIcolumn\fR must have type
string or set of strings.  The first nonempty string in the table is taken
as the file name.  (This means that ordinarily there should be at most
one row in \fItable\fR.)

.SH "RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS"
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) can send commands to a running
\fBovsdb\-server\fR process.  The currently supported commands are
described below.
.SS "OVSDB\-SERVER COMMANDS"
These commands are specific to \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
.IP "\fBexit\fR"
Causes \fBovsdb\-server\fR to gracefully terminate.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/compact\fR [\fIdb\fR]\&..."
Compacts each database \fIdb\fR in-place.  If no \fIdb\fR is
specified, compacts every database in-place.  A database is also
compacted automatically when a transaction is logged if it is over 4
times as large as its previous compacted size (and at least 10 MB),
but not before 100 commits have been added or 10 minutes have elapsed
since the last compaction.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/reconnect\fR"
Makes \fBovsdb\-server\fR drop all of the JSON\-RPC
connections to database clients and reconnect.
.IP
This command might be useful for debugging issues with database
clients.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote \fIremote\fR"
Adds a remote, as if \fB\-\-remote=\fIremote\fR had been specified on
the \fBovsdb\-server\fR command line.  (If \fIremote\fR is already a
remote, this command succeeds without changing the configuration.)
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/remove\-remote \fIremote\fR"
Removes the specified \fIremote\fR from the configuration, failing
with an error if \fIremote\fR is not configured as a remote.  This
command only works with remotes that were named on \fB\-\-remote\fR or
\fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote\fR, that is, it will not remove remotes
added indirectly because they were read from the database by
configuring a \fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR remote.
(You can remove a database source with \fBovsdb\-server/remove\-remote
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR, but not individual
remotes found indirectly through the database.)
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/list\-remotes"
Outputs a list of the currently configured remotes named on
\fB\-\-remote\fR or \fBovsdb\-server/add\-remote\fR, that is, it does
not list remotes added indirectly because they were read from the
database by configuring a
\fBdb:\fIdb\fB,\fItable\fB,\fIcolumn\fR remote.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/add\-db \fIdatabase\fR"
Adds the \fIdatabase\fR to the running \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  The database
file must already have been created and initialized using, for example,
\fBovsdb\-tool create\fR.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/remove\-db \fIdatabase\fR"
Removes \fIdatabase\fR from the running \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  \fIdatabase\fR
must be a database name as listed by \fBovsdb-server/list\-dbs\fR.
.IP
If a remote has been configured that points to the specified
\fIdatabase\fR (e.g. \fB\-\-remote=db:\fIdatabase\fB,\fR... on the
command line), then it will be disabled until another database with
the same name is added again (with \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR).
.IP
Any public key infrastructure options specified through this database
(e.g. \fB\-\-private\-key=db:\fIdatabase,\fR... on the command line)
will be disabled until another database with the same name is added
again (with \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR).
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/list\-dbs"
Outputs a list of the currently configured databases added either through
the command line or through the \fBovsdb\-server/add\-db\fR command.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/set\-active\-ovsdb\-server \fIserver"
Sets  the active \fIserver\fR from which \fBovsdb\-server\fR connects through
\fBovsdb\-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/get\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Gets the active server from which \fBovsdb\-server\fR is currently synchronizing
its databases.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/connect\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Causes \fBovsdb\-server\fR to synchronize its databases with the server
specified by \fBovsdb\-server/set\-active\-ovsdb\-server\fR.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/disconnect\-active\-ovsdb\-server"
Causes \fBovsdb\-server\fR to  stop  synchronizing  its  databases with a active server.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/set\-sync\-exclude\-tables \fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR[\fB,\fIdb\fB:\fItable\fR]..."
Sets the \fItable\fR whitin \fIdb\fR that will be excluded from synchronization.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/get\-sync\-exclude\-tables"
Gets  the  tables  that are currently excluded from synchronization.
.
.IP "\fBovsdb\-server/sync\-status"
Prints a summary of replication run time information. The \fBstate\fR
information is always provided, indicating whether the server is running
in the \fIactive\fR or the \fIbackup\fR mode.
When running in backup mode, replication connection status, which
can be either \fIconnecting\fR, \fIreplicating\fR or \fIerror\fR, are shown.
When the connection is in \fIreplicating\fR state, further output shows
the list of databases currently replicating, and the tables that are
excluded.

.SH "SPECIFICATIONS"
.
.PP
\fBovsdb\-server\fR implements the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB)
protocol specified in RFC 7047, with the following clarifications:
.
.IP "3.1. JSON Usage"
RFC 4627 says that names within a JSON object should be unique.
The Open vSwitch JSON parser discards all but the last value
for a name that is specified more than once.
.
.IP
The definition of <error> allows for implementation extensions.
Currently \fBovsdb\-server\fR uses the following additional "error"
strings which might change in later releases):
.
.RS
.IP "\fBsyntax error\fR or \fBunknown column\fR"
The request could not be parsed as an OVSDB request.  An additional
"syntax" member, whose value is a string that contains JSON, may
narrow down the particular syntax that could not be parsed.
.IP "\fBinternal error\fR"
The request triggered a bug in \fBovsdb\-server\fR.
.IP "\fBovsdb error\fR"
A map or set contains a duplicate key.
.IP "\fBpermission error\fR"
The request was denied by the role-based access control extension,
introduced in version 2.8.
.RE
.
.IP "3.2. Schema Format"
RFC 7047 requires the "version" field in <database-schema>.  Current
versions of \fBovsdb\-server\fR allow it to be omitted (future
versions are likely to require it).
.IP
RFC 7047 allows columns that contain weak references to be immutable.
This raises the issue of the behavior of the weak reference when the
rows that it references are deleted.  Since version 2.6,
\fBovsdb\-server\fR forces columns that contain weak references to be
mutable.
.IP
Since version 2.8, the table name \fBRBAC_Role\fR is used internally
by the role-based access control extension to \fBovsdb\-server\fR and
should not be used for purposes other than defining mappings of role
names to table access permissions. This table has one row per role
name and the following columns:
.RS
.IP "\fBname\fR"
The role name.
.IP "\fBpermissions\fR"
A map of table name to a reference to a row in a separate permission
table.
.RE
.IP
The separate RBAC permission table has one row per access control
configuration and the following columns:
.RS
.IP "\fBname\fR"
The name of the table to which the row applies.
.IP "\fBauthorization\fR"
The set of column names and column:key pairs to be compared with
the client ID in order to determine the authorization status of
the requested operation.
.IP "\fBinsert_delete\fR"
A boolean value, true if authorized insertions and authorized are allowed,
false if no insertions or deletions are allowed.
.IP "\fBupdate\fR"
The set of columns and column:key pairs for which authorized update and
mutate operations should be permitted.
.RE
.
.IP "4. Wire Protocol"
The original OVSDB specifications included the following reason,
omitted from RFC 7047, to operate JSON-RPC directly over a stream
instead of over HTTP:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
JSON-RPC is a peer-to-peer protocol, but HTTP is a client-server
protocol, which is a poor match.  Thus, JSON-RPC over HTTP requires
the client to periodically poll the server to receive server requests.
.IP \(bu
HTTP is more complicated than stream connections and doesn't provide
any corresponding advantage.
.IP \(bu
The JSON-RPC specification for HTTP transport is incomplete.
.RE
.
.IP "4.1.3. Transact"
Since version 2.8, role-based access controls can be applied to operations
within a transaction that would modify the contents of the database
(these operations include row insert, row delete, column update, and
column mutate). Role-based access controls are applied when the database
schema contains a table with the name "\fBRBAC_Role\fR" and the connection
on which the transaction request was received has an associated role
name (from the "\fBrole\fR" column in the remote connection table). When
role-based access controls are enabled, transactions that are otherwise
well-formed may be rejected depending on the client's role, ID, and the
contents of the \fBRBAC_Role\fR table and associated permissions table.
.
.IP "4.1.5. Monitor"
For backward compatibility, \fBovsdb\-server\fR currently permits a
single <monitor-request> to be used instead of an array; it is treated
as a single-element array.  Future versions of \fBovsdb\-server\fR
might remove this compatibility feature.
.IP
Because the <json-value> parameter is used to match subsequent update
notifications (see below) to the request, it must be unique among all
active monitors.  \fBovsdb\-server\fR rejects attempt to create two
monitors with the same identifier.
.
.IP "4.1.12. Monitor_cond"
A new monitor method added in Open vSwitch version 2.6. The monitor_cond
request enables a client to replicate subsets of tables within an OVSDB
database by requesting notifications of changes to rows matching one of
the conditions specified in "where" by receiving the specified contents
of these rows when table updates occur. Monitor_cond also allows a more
efficient update notifications by receiving table-updates2 notifications
(described below).
.
.IP
The monitor method described in Section 4.1.5 also applies to monitor_cond,
with the following exceptions:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
RPC request method becomes "monitor_cond".
.IP \(bu
Reply result follows <table-updates2>, described in Section 4.1.14.
.IP \(bu
Subsequent changes are sent to the client using the "update2" monitor
notification, described in Section 4.1.14
.IP \(bu
Update notifications are being sent only for rows matching [<condition>*].

.IP "5.1. Notation"
For <condition>, RFC 7047 only allows the use of \fB!=\fR, \fB==\fR,
\fBincludes\fR, and \fBexcludes\fR operators with set types.  Open
vSwitch 2.4 and later extend <condition> to allow the use of \fB<\fR,
\fB<=\fR, \fB>=\fR, and \fB>\fR operators with columns with type ``set
of 0 or 1 integer'' and ``set of 0 or 1 real''.  These conditions
evaluate to false when the column is empty, and otherwise as described
in RFC 7047 for integer and real types.
.
.IP
<condition> is specified in Section 5.1 in the RFC with the following change:
A condition can be either a 3-element JSON array as described in the RFC or a
boolean value. In case of an empty array an implicit true boolean value will be
considered.
.
.IP "5.2.6. Wait"
.IQ "5.2.7. Commit"
.IQ "5.2.9. Comment"
RFC 7047 says that the \fBwait\fR, \fBcommit\fR, and \fBcomment\fR
operations have no corresponding result object.  This is not true.
Instead, when such an operation is successful, it yields a result
object with no members.
.
.SH "BUGS"
.
In Open vSwitch before version 2.4, when \fBovsdb\-server\fR sent
JSON-RPC error responses to some requests, it incorrectly formulated
them with the \fBresult\fR and \fBerror\fR swapped, so that the
response appeared to indicate success (with a nonsensical result)
rather than an error.  The requests that suffered from this problem
were:
.
.IP \fBtransact\fR
.IQ \fBget_schema\fR
Only if the request names a nonexistent database.
.IP \fBmonitor\fR
.IQ \fBlock\fR
.IQ \fBunlock\fR
In all error cases.
.
.PP
Of these cases, the only error that a well-written application is
likely to encounter in practice is \fBmonitor\fR of tables or columns
that do not exist, in an situation where the application has been
