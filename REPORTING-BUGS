Reporting Bugs in Open vSwitch
==============================

We are eager to hear from users about problems that they have
encountered with Open vSwitch.  This file documents how best to report
bugs so as to ensure that they can be fixed as quickly as possible.

Please report bugs by sending email to bugs@openvswitch.org.  Include
as much of the following information as you can in your report:

        * The Open vSwitch version number (as output by "ovs-vswitchd
          --version").

        * The Git commit number (as output by "git rev-parse HEAD"),
          if you built from a Git snapshot.

        * Any local patches or changes you have applied (if any).

        * The kernel version on which Open vSwitch is running (from
          /proc/version) and the distribution and version number of
          your OS (e.g. "Centos 5.0").

        * The contents of the vswitchd configuration database (usually
          /etc/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db).

        * The output of "ovs-dpctl show".

        * If you have Open vSwitch configured to connect to an
          OpenFlow controller, the output of "ovs-ofctl show <bridge>"
          for each <bridge> configured in the vswitchd configuration
          file.

        * A description of the problem, which should include:

                - What you did that make the problem appear.

                - What you expected to happen.

                - What actually happened.

        * A fix or workaround, if you have one.
