/* Network device class structure, to be defined by each implementation of a

 *
 * These functions return 0 if successful or a positive errno value on failure,
 * except where otherwise noted.
 *
 *
 * Data Structures
 * ===============
 *
 * These functions work primarily with two different kinds of data structures:
 *
 *   - "struct netdev", which represents a network device.
 *
 *   - "struct netdev_rxq", which represents a handle for capturing packets
 *     received on a network device
 *
 * Each of these data structures contains all of the implementation-independent
 * generic state for the respective concept, called the "base" state.  None of
 * them contains any extra space for implementations to use.  Instead, each
 * implementation is expected to declare its own data structure that contains
 * an instance of the generic data structure plus additional
 * implementation-specific members, called the "derived" state.  The
 * implementation can use casts or (preferably) the CONTAINER_OF macro to
 * obtain access to derived state given only a pointer to the embedded generic
 * data structure.
 *
 *
 * Life Cycle
 * ==========
 *
 * Four stylized functions accompany each of these data structures:
 *
 *            "alloc"          "construct"        "destruct"       "dealloc"
 *            ------------   ----------------  ---------------  --------------
 * netdev      ->alloc        ->construct        ->destruct        ->dealloc
 * netdev_rxq  ->rxq_alloc    ->rxq_construct    ->rxq_destruct    ->rxq_dealloc
 *
 * Any instance of a given data structure goes through the following life
 * cycle:
 *
 *   1. The client calls the "alloc" function to obtain raw memory.  If "alloc"
 *      fails, skip all the other steps.
 *
 *   2. The client initializes all of the data structure's base state.  If this
 *      fails, skip to step 7.
 *
 *   3. The client calls the "construct" function.  The implementation
 *      initializes derived state.  It may refer to the already-initialized
 *      base state.  If "construct" fails, skip to step 6.
 *
 *   4. The data structure is now initialized and in use.
 *
 *   5. When the data structure is no longer needed, the client calls the
 *      "destruct" function.  The implementation uninitializes derived state.
 *      The base state has not been uninitialized yet, so the implementation
 *      may still refer to it.
 *
 *   6. The client uninitializes all of the data structure's base state.
 *
 *   7. The client calls the "dealloc" to free the raw memory.  The
 *      implementation must not refer to base or derived state in the data
 *      structure, because it has already been uninitialized.
 *
 * If netdev support multi-queue IO then netdev->construct should set initialize
 * netdev->n_rxq to number of queues.
 *
 * Each "alloc" function allocates and returns a new instance of the respective
 * data structure.  The "alloc" function is not given any information about the
 * use of the new data structure, so it cannot perform much initialization.
 * Its purpose is just to ensure that the new data structure has enough room
 * for base and derived state.  It may return a null pointer if memory is not
 * available, in which case none of the other functions is called.
 *
 * Each "construct" function initializes derived state in its respective data
 * structure.  When "construct" is called, all of the base state has already
 * been initialized, so the "construct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "construct" function is allowed to fail, in which case the client calls the
 * "dealloc" function (but not the "destruct" function).
 *
 * Each "destruct" function uninitializes and frees derived state in its
 * respective data structure.  When "destruct" is called, the base state has
 * not yet been uninitialized, so the "destruct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "destruct" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 * Each "dealloc" function frees raw memory that was allocated by the
 * "alloc" function.  The memory's base and derived members might not have ever
 * been initialized (but if "construct" returned successfully, then it has been
 * "destruct"ed already).  The "dealloc" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 *
 * Device Change Notification
 * ==========================
 *
 * Minimally, implementations are required to report changes to netdev flags,
 * features, ethernet address or carrier through connectivity_seq. Changes to
 * other properties are allowed to cause notification through this interface,
 * although implementations should try to avoid this. connectivity_seq_get()
 * can be used to acquire a reference to the struct seq. The interface is
 * described in detail in seq.h. */
