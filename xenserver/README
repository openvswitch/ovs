This directory contains files for seamless integration of Open vSwitch on
Citrix XenServer hosts managed by the Citrix management tools.

Some of these files are modifications of Citrix's proprietary code.
Citrix has given permission to distribute these modified files.
Citrix has not specified a particular license for them.  There is no
guarantee that, should Citrix specify a license, that it would be
DFSG-compliant or GPL-compatible.

Most of the files in this directory is installed on a XenServer system
under the same name, if underscores are replaced by slashes.  The
files are:

    etc_init.d_openvswitch

        Initializes Open vSwitch at boot and shuts it down at shutdown.

    etc_init.d_openvswitch-xapi-update

        Init script to ensure openvswitch-cfg-update is called for the
        current host at boot.

    etc_logrotate.d_openvswitch

        Ensures that logs in /var/log/openvswitch are rotated
        periodically and that appropriate daemons reopen their log
        files at that point.

    etc_profile.d_openvswitch.sh

        Open vSwitch-related shell functions for the administrator's
        convenience.

    etc_xapi.d_plugins_openvswitch-cfg-update

        xapi plugin script to update the cache of configuration items
        in the ovs-vswitchd configuration that are managed in the
        xapi database when integrated with Citrix management tools.

    etc_xensource_scripts_vif

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    openvswitch-xen.spec

        spec file for building RPMs to install on a XenServer host.

    opt_xensource_libexec_interface-reconfigure

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_monitor-external-ids

        Daemon to monitor the external_ids columns of the Bridge and
        Interface OVSDB tables.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_refresh-xs-network-uuids

        Script to refresh Bridge table external-ids:xs-network-uuids
        values, which can get out-of-sync following a pool join.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_sysconfig.template

        Template for Open vSwitch's /etc/sysconfig/openvswitch 
        configuration file.

    usr_lib_xsconsole_plugins-base_XSFeatureVSwitch.py

        xsconsole plugin to configure the pool-wide configuration keys
        used to control Open vSwitch when integrated with Citrix 
        management tools.

    usr_sbin_brctl

        wrapper for /usr/sbin/brctl that provides some additional
        bridge compatibility

    usr_sbin_xen-bugtool

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    uuid.py

        This is uuid.py from Python 2.5.  It is installed into the
        Open vSwitch RPM because XenServer 5.5 and 5.6 use Python 2.4,
        which do not have uuid.py.

To install, build the Open vSwitch RPM with a command like this:

        rpmbuild -D "openvswitch_version $full_version" \
                -D "xen_version $XENKERNEL" \
                -D "build_number --with-build-number=$buildnr" \
                -bb openvswitch-xen.spec

Then, "rpm -U" the resulting Open vSwitch package on the XenServer hosts in
question and reboot them.  (The openvswitch-dbg package that is also
produced need not be installed, but it is harmless to do so.)
