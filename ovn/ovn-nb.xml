    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-northd</code> program
    monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN_Southbound"/> database.

    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

    <p>
      There are two kinds of logical switches, that is, ones that fully
      virtualize the network (overlay logical switches) and ones that provide
      simple connectivity to a physical network (bridged logical switches).
      They work in the same way when providing connectivity between logical
      ports on same chasis, but differently when connecting remote logical
      ports.  Overlay logical switches connect remote logical ports by tunnels,
      while bridged logical switches provide connectivity to remote ports by
      bridging the packets to directly connected physical L2 segment with the
      help of <code>localnet</code> ports.  Each bridged logical switch has
      one and only one <code>localnet</code> port, which has only one special
      address <code>unknown</code>.

      <p>
        When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
        expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container.  OVN can use VLAN tags
        to support such cases.  Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each
        packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
        appropriate ID for the container.  Such VLAN IDs never appear on a
        physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except
        relative to a single VM on a hypervisor.
      </p>

      <p>
        These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers using
        shared VIFs.  For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
        are empty.

      <column name="up">
        This column is populated by <code>ovn-northd</code>, rather than by the

        to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database <ref
        db="OVN_Southbound" table="Binding"/> table, <code>ovn-northd</code>
        sets this column to <code>true</code>; otherwise, or if the port
        becomes unbound later, it sets it to <code>false</code>.  This allows
        the CMS to wait for a VM's (or container's) networking to become active
        before it allows the VM (or container) to start.
      </column>

      <column name="enabled">
        This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this column
        is empty or is set to <code>true</code>, the port is enabled.  If this

    <group title="Addressing">
      <column name="addresses">
        <p>
          Addresses owned by the logical port.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>Ethernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port.
              Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has
              a single fixed Ethernet address.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame
              whose destination MAC address is in a logical port's <ref
              column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it only to that port, as
              if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the
              port.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates
              that the logical port owns the given IP addresses.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this
              information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without
              traversing the physical network. The OVN logical router connected
              to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid
              issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that the order here is important. The Ethernet address must
              be listed before the IP address(es) if defined.
            </p>

            <p>
              Examples:

              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the above mac address.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4 20.0.0.4</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and two
                IPv4 addresses.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and
                1 IPv6 address.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and
                1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 address.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>unknown</code></dt>
          <dd>
            This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet
            addresses.  When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
            frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port's
            <ref column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it to the port (or
            ports) whose <ref column="addresses"/> columns include
            <code>unknown</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </column>

      <column name="port_security">
        <p>
          This column controls the addresses from which the host attached to the
          logical port (``the host'') is allowed to send packets and to which it
          is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
          are permitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must begin with one Ethernet address.
          This would restrict the host to sending packets from and receiving
          packets to the ethernet addresses defined in the logical port's
          <ref column="port_security"/> column. It also restricts the inner
          source MAC addresses that the host may send in ARP and IPv6
          Neighbor Discovery packets. The host is always allowed to receive packets
          to multicast and broadcast Ethernet addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set may additionally contain one or more IPv4 or
          IPv6 addresses (or both), with optional masks.  If a mask is given, it
          must be a CIDR mask.  In addition to the restrictions described for
          Ethernet addresses above, such an element restricts the IPv4 or IPv6
          addresses from which the host may send and to which it may receive
          packets to the specified addresses.  A masked address, if the host part
          is zero, indicates that the host is allowed to use any address in the
          subnet; if the host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the size
          of the subnet. In addition:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If any IPv4 address is given, the host is also allowed to receive
              packets to the IPv4 local broadcast address 255.255.255.255 and to
              IPv4 multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/4).  If an IPv4 address with a
              mask is given, the host is also allowed to receive packets to the
              broadcast address in that specified subnet.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any IPv4 address is given, the host is additionally restricted
              to sending ARP packets with the specified source IPv4 address.
              (RARP is not restricted.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If any IPv6 address is given, the host is also allowed to receive
              packets to IPv6 multicast addresses (ff00::/8).
            </p>

            <p>
              If any IPv6 address is given, the host is additionally restricted
              to sending IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Solicitation or Advertisement
              packets with the specified source address or, for solicitations,
              the unspecified address.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If an element includes an IPv4 address, but no IPv6 addresses, then
          IPv6 traffic is not allowed.  If an element includes an IPv6 address,
          but no IPv4 address, then IPv4 and ARP traffic is not allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This column uses the same lexical syntax as the <ref column="match"
          table="Pipeline" db="OVN_Southbound"/> column in the OVN Southbound
          database's <ref table="Pipeline" db="OVN_Southbound"/> table.  Multiple
          addresses within an element may be space or comma separated.

        <p>
          This column is provided as a convenience to cloud management systems,
          but all of the features that it implements can be implemented as ACLs
          using the <ref table="ACL"/> table.

          Examples:

          <dd>
            The host may send traffic from and receive traffic to the specified
            MAC address, and to receive traffic to Ethernet multicast and
            broadcast addresses, but not otherwise.  The host may not send ARP or
            IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets with inner source Ethernet addresses
            other than the one specified.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24</code></dt>
          <dd>
            This adds further restrictions to the first example.  The host may
            send IPv4 packets from or receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10,
            except that it may also receive IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based
            on the subnet mask), 255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4.
            The host may not send ARPs with a source Ethernet address other than
            80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 or source IPv4 address other than 192.168.1.10.
            The host may not send or receive any IPv6 (including IPv6 Neighbor
            Discovery) traffic.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>"80:fa:5b:12:42:ba", "80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 192.168.1.10/24"</code></dt>
          <dd>

      Each row in this table represents a named set of addresses.
      An address set may contain Ethernet, IPv4, or IPv6 addresses
      with optional bitwise or CIDR masks.
      Address set may ultimately be used in ACLs to compare against
      fields such as <code>ip4.src</code> or <code>ip6.src</code>.
      A single address set must contain addresses of the

      Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch

      <ref column="match"/>, and <code>deny</code> as <ref column="action"/>.)
    </p>

    <column name="priority">
      <p>
        The ACL rule's priority.  Rules with numerically higher priority
        take precedence over those with lower.  If two ACL rules with

        packet is undefined.

        By default all traffic is allowed.  When writing a more

        Note that you can not create an ACL matching on a port with
