  <p>
    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-northd</code> program
    monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN_Southbound"/> database.

  <p>
    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

    </column>

    <column name="parent_name">
      When <ref column="name"/> identifies the interface of a container
      spawned inside a tenant VM, this column represents the VM interface
      through which the container interface sends its network traffic.
      The name used here must match those used in the <ref key="iface-id"
      table="Interface" column="external_ids" db="Open_vSwitch"/> in the
      <ref db="Open_vSwitch"/> table, because hypervisors in this case use
      <ref key="iface-id" table="Interface" column="external_ids"
      db="Open_vSwitch"/> as a lookup key to identify the network interface
      of the tenant VM.
    </column>

    <column name="tag">
     <p>
      When <ref column="type"/> is empty and <ref column="name"/> identifies
      the interface of a container spawned inside a tenant VM, this column
      identifies the VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with that
      container's network interface. When there are multiple container
      interfaces inside a VM, all of them send their network traffic through a
      single VM network interface and this value helps OVN identify the correct
      container interface.
     </p>

     <p>
      When <ref column="type"/> is set to <code>localnet</code>, this can be
      set to indicate that the port represents a connection to a specific
      VLAN on a locally accessible network. The VLAN ID is used to match
      incoming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic.
     </p>
    </column>

    <column name="up">
      This column is populated by <code>ovn-northd</code>, rather than by
      the CMS plugin as is most of this database.  When a logical port is bound
      to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database <ref
      db="OVN_Southbound" table="Binding"/> table, <code>ovn-northd</code>
      sets this column to <code>true</code>; otherwise, or if the port
      becomes unbound later, it sets it to <code>false</code>.  This
      allows the CMS to wait for a VM's (or container's) networking to
      become active before it allows the VM (or container) to start.
    </column>

    <column name="enabled">
      This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this column is
      empty or is set to <code>true</code>, the port is enabled.  If this column
      is set to <code>false</code>, the port is disabled.  A disabled port has all
      ingress and egress traffic dropped.
    </column>

    <column name="addresses">
      <p>
        Addresses owned by the logical port.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code><var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var></code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            An Ethernet address owned by the logical port.  Like a physical
            Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single fixed Ethernet
            address.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose
            destination MAC address is in a logical port's <ref
            column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it only to that port, as
            if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the port.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code><var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var> <var>a</var>.<var>b</var>.<var>c</var>.<var>d</var></code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This form has all the effects of the previous form.  It also
            indicates that the logical port owns the given IPv4 address.
          </p>

          <p>
            The OVN logical switch uses this information to synthesize
            responses to ARP requests without traversing the physical network.
            The OVN logical router connected to the logical switch, if any,
            uses this information to avoid issuing ARP requests for logical
            switch ports.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>unknown</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet
          addresses.  When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
          frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port's <ref
          column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it to the port (or ports)
          whose <ref column="addresses"/> columns include <code>unknown</code>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </column>

    <column name="port_security">
      <p>
        A set of L2 (Ethernet) addresses
        from which the logical port is allowed to send packets and to which it
        is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
        are permitted.  Logical ports are always allowed to receive packets
        addressed to multicast and broadcast addresses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each member of the set is an Ethernet address in the form
        <var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>:<var>xx</var>.
      </p>

        This specification will be extended to support L3 port security.

  <table name="ACL" title="Access Control List (ACL) rule">
    <p>
      Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch
      that points to it through its <ref column="acls"/> column.  The <ref

      matching row in this table determines a packet's treatment.  If no row

      <ref column="match"/>, and <code>deny</code> as <ref column="action"/>.)
    </p>

    <column name="priority">
      <p>
        The ACL rule's priority.  Rules with numerically higher priority

        By default all traffic is allowed.  When writing a more
