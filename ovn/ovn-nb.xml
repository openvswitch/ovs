  <p>
    This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
    (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.  The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-northd</code> program
    monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the <ref
    db="OVN_Southbound"/> database.

    We generally speak of ``the'' CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
    which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

  <h2>External IDs</h2>

    Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named

    <p>
      There are two kinds of logical switches, that is, ones that fully
      virtualize the network (overlay logical switches) and ones that provide
      simple connectivity to a physical network (bridged logical switches).
      They work in the same way when providing connectivity between logical
      ports on same chasis, but differently when connecting remote logical
      ports.  Overlay logical switches connect remote logical ports by tunnels,
      while bridged logical switches provide connectivity to remote ports by
      bridging the packets to directly connected physical L2 segment with the
      help of <code>localnet</code> ports.  Each bridged logical switch has
      one and only one <code>localnet</code> port, which has only one special
      address <code>unknown</code>.

        These columns provide names for the logical switch.  From OVN's

        to provide convenience for human interaction with the  database.
        There is no requirement for the name to be unique.  (For a unique

        a human-friendly name, but the Neutron integration used it to uniquely

        <code>neutron-<var>uuid</var></code>.  Later on, Neutron started
        propagating the friendly name of a switch as <ref column="external_ids"

        <p>
          Whether listed or not, <code>ovn-northd</code> will never allocate

          This column is populated by <code>ovn-northd</code>, rather
          than by the CMS plugin as is most of this database.  When a
          logical port is bound to a physical location in the OVN
          Southbound database <ref db="OVN_Southbound"
          table="Binding"/> table, <code>ovn-northd</code> sets this
          column to <code>true</code>; otherwise, or if the port
          becomes unbound later, it sets it to <code>false</code>.
          This allows the CMS to wait for a VM's (or container's)
          networking to become active before it allows the VM (or
          container) to start.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logical ports of router type are an exception to this rule.

      <column name="enabled">
        This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this column

    <group title="Addressing">

          Addresses owned by the logical port.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>Ethernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port.
              Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has
              a single fixed Ethernet address.
            </p>

            <p>
              When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame
              whose destination MAC address is in a logical port's <ref
              column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it only to that port, as
              if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the
              port.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates
              that the logical port owns the given IP addresses.
            </p>

            <p>
              If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this
              information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without
              traversing the physical network. The OVN logical router connected
              to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid
              issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that the order here is important. The Ethernet address must
              be listed before the IP address(es) if defined.
            </p>

            <p>
              Examples:

              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the above mac address.

              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and two
                IPv4 addresses.
              </dd>

              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and

              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 10.0.0.4 fdaa:15f2:72cf:0:f816:3eff:fe20:3f41</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the mac address and

            </dl>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>unknown</code></dt>
          <dd>
            This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet
            addresses.  When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
            frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port's
            <ref column="addresses"/> column, it delivers it to the port (or
            ports) whose <ref column="addresses"/> columns include
            <code>unknown</code>.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>dynamic</code></dt>
          <dd>
            Use this keyword to make <code>ovn-northd</code> generate a
            globally unique MAC address and choose an unused IPv4 address with
            the logical port's subnet and store them in the port's <ref
            column="dynamic_addresses"/> column.  <code>ovn-northd</code> will
            use the subnet specified in <ref table="Logical_Switch"
            column="other_config" key="subnet"/> in the port's <ref
            table="Logical_Switch"/>.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>Ethernet address followed by keyword "dynamic"</code></dt>
          <dd>

            <p>
              The keyword <code>dynamic</code> after the MAC address indicates
              that <code>ovn-northd</code> should choose an unused IPv4 address
              from the logical port's subnet and store it with the specified
              MAC in the port's <ref column="dynamic_addresses"/> column.
              <code>ovn-northd</code> will use the subnet specified in <ref
              table="Logical_Switch" column="other_config" key="subnet"/> in
              the port's <ref table="Logical_Switch"/> table.
            </p>

            <p>
              Examples:

            <dl>
              <dt><code>80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This indicates that the logical port owns the specified
                MAC address and <code>ovn-northd</code> should allocate an
                unused IPv4 address for the logical port from the corresponding
                logical switch subnet.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>router</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Accepted only when <ref column="type"/> is <code>router</code>.
              This indicates that the Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6 addresses for
              this logical switch port should be obtained from the connected
              logical router port, as specified by <code>router-port</code> in
              <ref column="options"/>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The resulting addresses are used to populate the logical
              switch's destination lookup, and also for the logical switch
              to generate ARP and ND replies.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the connected logical router port has a
              <code>redirect-chassis</code> specified and the logical router
              has rules specified in <ref column="nat" table="Logical_Router"/>
              with <ref column="external_mac" table="NAT"/>, then those
              addresses are also used to populate the switch's destination
              lookup.
            </p>

            <p>
              Supported only in OVN 2.7 and later.  Earlier versions required
              router addresses to be manually synchronized.

          Addresses will be of the same format as those that populate the <ref

      <column name="port_security">
        <p>
          This column controls the addresses from which the host attached to the
          logical port (``the host'') is allowed to send packets and to which it
          is allowed to receive packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses
          are permitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set must begin with one Ethernet address.
          This would restrict the host to sending packets from and receiving
          packets to the ethernet addresses defined in the logical port's
          <ref column="port_security"/> column. It also restricts the inner
          source MAC addresses that the host may send in ARP and IPv6
          Neighbor Discovery packets. The host is always allowed to receive packets
          to multicast and broadcast Ethernet addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each element in the set may additionally contain one or more IPv4 or
          IPv6 addresses (or both), with optional masks.  If a mask is given, it
          must be a CIDR mask.  In addition to the restrictions described for
          Ethernet addresses above, such an element restricts the IPv4 or IPv6
          addresses from which the host may send and to which it may receive
          packets to the specified addresses.  A masked address, if the host part
          is zero, indicates that the host is allowed to use any address in the
          subnet; if the host part is nonzero, the mask simply indicates the size
          of the subnet. In addition:

            <p>
              If any IPv4 address is given, the host is also allowed to receive

              IPv4 multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/4).  If an IPv4 address with a
              mask is given, the host is also allowed to receive packets to the
              broadcast address in that specified subnet.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any IPv4 address is given, the host is additionally restricted
              to sending ARP packets with the specified source IPv4 address.
              (RARP is not restricted.)

          <li>
            <p>
              If any IPv6 address is given, the host is also allowed to receive
              packets to IPv6 multicast addresses (ff00::/8).
            </p>

            <p>
              If any IPv6 address is given, the host is additionally restricted
              to sending IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Solicitation or Advertisement
              packets with the specified source address or, for solicitations,
              the unspecified address.

        <p>
          If an element includes an IPv4 address, but no IPv6 addresses, then
          IPv6 traffic is not allowed.  If an element includes an IPv6 address,

          <dd>
            This adds further restrictions to the first example.  The host may

            The host may not send ARPs with a source Ethernet address other than
            80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 or source IPv4 address other than 192.168.1.10.
            The host may not send or receive any IPv6 (including IPv6 Neighbor
            Discovery) traffic.

            The host may send traffic from and receive traffic to the

            but not otherwise.   With MAC 80:fa:5b:12:42:ba, the host may
            send traffic from and receive traffic to any L3 address.
            With MAC 80:fa:5b:06:72:b7, the host may send IPv4 packets from or
            receive IPv4 packets to only 192.168.1.10, except that it may also
            receive IPv4 packets to 192.168.1.255 (based on the subnet mask),
            255.255.255.255, and any address in 224.0.0.0/4.  The host may not

        their corresponding endpoint IP addresses (and optional port numbers
        with <code>:</code> as separators) separated by commas.  If
        the destination IP address (and port number) of a packet leaving a
        container or a VM matches the virtual IP address (and port number)
        provided here as a key, then OVN will statefully replace the
        destination IP address by one of the provided IP address (and port

        for load balancing; however a VIP of one address family may not be
        mapped to a destination IP address of a different family.  If

      <column name="options" key="redirect-chassis">
        <p>
          If set, this indicates that this logical router port represents
          a distributed gateway port that connects this router to a logical
          switch with a localnet port.  There may be at most one such
          logical router port on each logical router.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even when a <code>redirect-chassis</code> is specified, the
          logical router port still effectively resides on each chassis.
          However, due to the implications of the use of L2 learning in the
          physical network, as well as the need to support advanced features
          such as one-to-many NAT (aka IP masquerading), a subset of the
          logical router processing is handled in a centralized manner on
          the specified <code>redirect-chassis</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When this option is specified, the peer logical switch port's
          <ref column="addresses" table="Logical_Switch_Port"/> must be
          set to <code>router</code>.  With this setting, the <ref
          column="external_mac" table="NAT"/>s specified in NAT rules are
          automatically programmed in the peer logical switch's
          destination lookup on the chassis where the <ref
          column="logical_port" table="NAT"/> resides.  In addition, the
          logical router's MAC address is automatically programmed in the
          peer logical switch's destination lookup flow on the
          <code>redirect-chassis</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When this option is specified and it is desired to generate
          gratuitous ARPs for NAT addresses, then the peer logical switch
          port's <ref column="options" key="nat-addresses"
          table="Logical_Switch_Port"/> should be set to
          <code>router</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While <ref column="options" key="redirect-chassis"/> is still
          supported for backwards compatibility, it is now preferred to
          specify one or more <ref column="gateway_chassis"/> instead.
          It is functionally equivalent, but allows you to specify multiple
          chassis to enable high availability.
