<database name="ovn" title="OVN Database">
  <p>
    This database holds logical and physical configuration and state for the
    Open Virtual Network (OVN) system to support virtual network abstraction.
    For an introduction to OVN, please see <code>ovn-architecture</code>(7).
  </p>

  <p>
    The OVN database sits at the center of the OVN architecture.  It is the one
    component that speaks both southbound directly to all the hypervisors and
    gateways, via <code>ovn-controller</code>, and northbound to the Cloud
    Management System, via <code>ovn-nbd</code>:
  </p>

  <h2>Database Structure</h2>

  <p>
    The OVN database contains three classes of data with different properties,
    as described in the sections below.
  </p>

  <h3>Physical Network (PN) data</h3>

  <p>
    PN tables contain information about the chassis nodes in the system.  This
    contains all the information necessary to wire the overlay, such as IP
    addresses, supported tunnel types, and security keys.
  </p>

  <p>
    The amount of PN data is small (O(n) in the number of chassis) and it
    changes infrequently, so it can be replicated to every chassis.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <ref table="Chassis"/> and <ref table="Gateway"/> tables comprise the
    PN tables.
  </p>

  <h3>Logical Network (LN) data</h3>

  <p>
    LN tables contain the topology of logical switches and routers, ACLs,
    firewall rules, and everything needed to describe how packets traverse a
    logical network, represented as logical datapath flows (see Logical
    Datapath Flows, below).
  </p>

  <p>
    LN data may be large (O(n) in the number of logical ports, ACL rules,
    etc.).  Thus, to improve scaling, each chassis should receive only data
    related to logical networks in which that chassis participates.  Past
    experience shows that in the presence of large logical networks, even
    finer-grained partitioning of data, e.g. designing logical flows so that
    only the chassis hosting a logical port needs related flows, pays off
    scale-wise.  (This is not necessary initially but it is worth bearing in
    mind in the design.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The LN is a slave of the cloud management system running northbound of OVN.
    That CMS determines the entire OVN logical configuration and therefore the
    LN's content at any given time is a deterministic function of the CMS's
    configuration, although that happens indirectly via the OVN Northbound DB
    and <code>ovn-nbd</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    LN data is likely to change more quickly than PN data.  This is especially
    true in a container environment where VMs are created and destroyed (and
    therefore added to and deleted from logical switches) quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <ref table="Pipeline"/> table is currently the only LN table.
  </p>

  <h3>Bindings data</h3>

  <p>
    The Bindings tables contain the current placement of logical components
    (such as VMs and VIFs) onto chassis and the bindings between logical ports
    and MACs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bindings change frequently, at least every time a VM powers up or down
    or migrates, and especially quickly in a container environment.  The
    amount of data per VM (or VIF) is small.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each chassis is authoritative about the VMs and VIFs that it hosts at any
    given time and can efficiently flood that state to a central location, so
    the consistency needs are minimal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <ref table="Bindings"/> table is currently the only Bindings table.
  </p>

  <table name="Chassis" title="Physical Network Hypervisor and Gateway Information">
    <p>
      Each row in this table represents a hypervisor or gateway (a chassis) in
      the physical network (PN).  Each chassis, via
      <code>ovn-controller</code>, adds and updates its own row, and keeps a
      copy of the remaining rows to determine how to reach other hypervisors.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should remove its own row.
      (This is not critical because resources hosted on the chassis are equally
      unreachable regardless of whether the row is present.)  If a chassis
      shuts down permanently without removing its row, some kind of manual or
      automatic cleanup is eventually needed; we can devise a process for that
      as necessary.
    </p>

    <column name="name">
      A chassis name, taken from <ref key="system-id" table="Open_vSwitch"
      column="external_ids" db="Open_vSwitch"/> in the Open_vSwitch
      database's <ref table="Open_vSwitch" db="Open_vSwitch"/> table.  OVN does
      not prescribe a particular format for chassis names.
    </column>

    <group title="Encapsulation Configuration">
      <p>
        OVN uses encapsulation to transmit logical dataplane packets
        between chassis.
      </p>

      <column name="encaps">
        Points to supported encapsulation configurations to transmit
        logical dataplane packets to this chassis.  Each entry is a <ref
        table="Encap"/> record that describes the configuration.
      </column>
    </group>

    <group title="Gateway Configuration">
      <p>
        A <dfn>gateway</dfn> is a chassis that forwards traffic between a
        logical network and a physical VLAN.  Gateways are typically dedicated
        nodes that do not host VMs.
      </p>

      <column name="gateway_ports">
        Maps from the name of a gateway port, which is typically a physical
        port (e.g. <code>eth1</code>) or an Open vSwitch patch port, to a <ref
        table="Gateway"/> record that describes the details of the gatewaying
        function.
      </column>
    </group>
  </table>

  <table name="Encap" title="Encapsulation Types">
    <p>
      The <ref column="encaps" table="Chassis"/> column in the <ref
      table="Chassis"/> table refers to rows in this table to identify
      how OVN may transmit logical dataplane packets to this chassis.
      Each chassis, via <code>ovn-controller</code>(8), adds and updates
      its own rows and keeps a copy of the remaining rows to determine
      how to reach other chassis.
    </p>

    <column name="type">
      The encapsulation to use to transmit packets to this chassis.
      Examples include <code>geneve</code>, <code>vxlan</code>, and
      <code>stt</code>.
    </column>

    <column name="options">
      Options for configuring the encapsulation, e.g. IPsec parameters when
      IPsec support is introduced.  No options are currently defined.
    </column>

    <column name="ip">
      The IPv4 address of the encapsulation tunnel endpoint.
    </column>
  </table>

  <table name="Gateway" title="Physical Network Gateway Ports">
    <p>
      The <ref column="gateway_ports" table="Chassis"/> column in the <ref
      table="Chassis"/> table refers to rows in this table to connect a chassis
      port to a gateway function.  Each row in this table describes the logical
      networks to which a gateway port is attached.  Each chassis, via
      <code>ovn-controller</code>(8), adds and updates its own rows, if any
      (since most chassis are not gateways), and keeps a copy of the remaining
      rows to determine how to reach other chassis.
    </p>

    <column name="vlan_map">
      Maps from a VLAN ID to a logical port name.  Thus, each named logical
      port corresponds to one VLAN on the gateway port.
    </column>

    <column name="attached_port">
      The name of the gateway port in the chassis's Open vSwitch integration
      bridge.
    </column>
  </table>

  <table name="Pipeline" title="Logical Network Pipeline">
    <p>
      Each row in this table represents one logical flow.  The cloud management
      system, via its OVN integration, populates this table with logical flows
      that implement the L2 and L3 topology specified in the CMS configuration.
      Each hypervisor, via <code>ovn-controller</code>, translates the logical
      flows into OpenFlow flows specific to its hypervisor and installs them
      into Open vSwitch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Logical flows are expressed in an OVN-specific format, described here.  A
      logical datapath flow is much like an OpenFlow flow, except that the
      flows are written in terms of logical ports and logical datapaths instead
      of physical ports and physical datapaths.  Translation between logical
      and physical flows helps to ensure isolation between logical datapaths.
      (The logical flow abstraction also allows the CMS to do less work, since
      it does not have to separately compute and push out physical physical
      flows to each chassis.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The default action when no flow matches is to drop packets.
    </p>

    <column name="table_id">
      The stage in the logical pipeline, analogous to an OpenFlow table number.
    </column>

    <column name="priority">
      The flow's priority.  Flows with numerically higher priority take
      precedence over those with lower.  If two logical datapath flows with the
      same priority both match, then the one actually applied to the packet is
      undefined.
    </column>

    <column name="match">
      <p>
        A matching expression.  OVN provides a superset of OpenFlow matching
        capabilities, using a syntax similar to Boolean expressions in a
        programming language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Matching expressions have two important kinds of primary expression:
        <dfn>fields</dfn> and <dfn>constants</dfn>.  A field names a piece of
        data or metadata.  The supported fields are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>metadata</code> <code>reg0</code> ... <code>reg7</code>
          <code>xreg0</code> ... <code>xreg3</code>
        </li>
        <li><code>inport</code> <code>outport</code> <code>queue</code></li>
        <li><code>eth.src</code> <code>eth.dst</code> <code>eth.type</code></li>
        <li><code>vlan.tci</code> <code>vlan.vid</code> <code>vlan.pcp</code> <code>vlan.present</code></li>
        <li><code>ip.proto</code> <code>ip.dscp</code> <code>ip.ecn</code> <code>ip.ttl</code> <code>ip.frag</code></li>
        <li><code>ip4.src</code> <code>ip4.dst</code></li>
        <li><code>ip6.src</code> <code>ip6.dst</code> <code>ip6.label</code></li>
        <li><code>arp.op</code> <code>arp.spa</code> <code>arp.tpa</code> <code>arp.sha</code> <code>arp.tha</code></li>
        <li><code>tcp.src</code> <code>tcp.dst</code> <code>tcp.flags</code></li>
        <li><code>udp.src</code> <code>udp.dst</code></li>
        <li><code>sctp.src</code> <code>sctp.dst</code></li>
        <li><code>icmp4.type</code> <code>icmp4.code</code></li>
        <li><code>icmp6.type</code> <code>icmp6.code</code></li>
        <li><code>nd.target</code> <code>nd.sll</code> <code>nd.tll</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Subfields may be addressed using a <code>[]</code> suffix,
        e.g. <code>tcp.src[0..7]</code> refers to the low 8 bits of the TCP
        source port.  A subfield may be used in any context a field is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some fields have prerequisites.  OVN implicitly adds clauses to satisfy
        these.  For example, <code>arp.op == 1</code> is equivalent to
        <code>eth.type == 0x0806 &amp;&amp; arp.op == 1</code>, and
        <code>tcp.src == 80</code> is equivalent to <code>(eth.type == 0x0800
        || eth.type == 0x86dd) &amp;&amp; ip.proto == 6 &amp;&amp; tcp.src ==
        80</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most fields have integer values.  Integer constants may be expressed in
        several forms: decimal integers, hexadecimal integers prefixed by
        <code>0x</code>, dotted-quad IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses in their
        standard forms, and as Ethernet addresses as colon-separated hex
        digits.  A constant in any of these forms may be followed by a slash
        and a second constant (the mask) in the same form, to form a masked
        constant.  IPv4 and IPv6 masks may be given as integers, to express
        CIDR prefixes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>inport</code> and <code>outport</code> fields have string
        values.  The useful values are <ref column="logical_port"/> names from
        the <ref column="Bindings"/> and <ref column="Gateway"/> table.
      </p>

      <p>
        The available operators, from highest to lowest precedence, are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>()</code></li>
        <li><code>==   !=   &lt;   &lt;=   &gt;   &gt;=   in   not in</code></li>
        <li><code>!</code></li>
        <li><code>&amp;&amp;</code></li>
        <li><code>||</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The <code>()</code> operator is used for grouping.
      </p>

      <p>
        The equality operator <code>==</code> is the most important operator.
        Its operands must be a field and an optionally masked constant, in
        either order.  The <code>==</code> operator yields true when the
        field's value equals the constant's value for all the bits included in
        the mask.  The <code>==</code> operator translates simply and naturally
        to OpenFlow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inequality operator <code>!=</code> yields the inverse of
        <code>==</code> but its syntax and use are the same.  Implementation of
        the inequality operator is expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The relational operators are &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=.  Their
        operands must be a field and a constant, in either order; the constant
        must not be masked.  These operators are most commonly useful for L4
        ports, e.g. <code>tcp.src &lt; 1024</code>.  Implementation of the
        relational operators is expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The set membership operator <code>in</code>, with syntax
        ``<code><var>field</var> in { <var>constant1</var>,
        <var>constant2</var>,</code> ... <code>}</code>'', is syntactic sugar
        for ``<code>(<var>field</var> == <var>constant1</var> ||
        <var>field</var> == <var>constant2</var> || </code>...<code>)</code>.
        Conversely, ``<code><var>field</var> not in { <var>constant1</var>,
        <var>constant2</var>, </code>...<code> }</code>'' is syntactic sugar
        for ``<code>(<var>field</var> != <var>constant1</var> &amp;&amp;
        <var>field</var> != <var>constant2</var> &amp;&amp;
        </code>...<code>)</code>''.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unary prefix operator <code>!</code> yields its operand's inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The logical AND operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code> yields true only if
        both of its operands are true.
      </p>

      <p>
        The logical OR operator <code>||</code> yields true if at least one of
        its operands is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the keywords <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> may also
        be used in matching expressions.  <code>true</code> is useful by itself
        as a catch-all expression that matches every packet.
      </p>

      <p>
        (The above is pretty ambitious.  It probably makes sense to initially
        implement only a subset of this specification.  The full specification
        is written out mainly to get an idea of what a fully general matching
        expression language could include.)
      </p>
    </column>

    <column name="actions">
      <p>
        Below, a <var>value</var> is either a <var>constant</var> or a
        <var>field</var>.  The following actions seem most likely to be useful:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>drop;</code></dt>
        <dd>syntactic sugar for no actions</dd>

        <dt><code>output(<var>value</var>);</code></dt>

          <dd>
            decrement TTL; execute first set of actions if
            successful, second set if TTL decrement fails
          </dd>

	  <dd>generate ARP from packet, execute <var>action</var>s</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Other actions can be added as needed
        (e.g. <code>push_vlan</code>, <code>pop_vlan</code>,
        <code>push_mpls</code>, <code>pop_mpls</code>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the OVN actions do not map directly to OpenFlow actions, e.g.:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>with</code>: Implemented as <code>stack_push;
          set(</code>...<code>); <var>actions</var>; stack_pop</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>dec_ttl</code>: Implemented as <code>dec_ttl</code> followed
          by the successful actions.  The failure case has to be implemented by
          ovn-controller interpreting packet-ins.  It might be difficult to
          identify the particular place in the processing pipeline in
          <code>ovn-controller</code>; maybe some restrictions will be
          necessary.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>icmp_reply</code>: Implemented by sending the packet to
          <code>ovn-controller</code>, which generates the ICMP reply and sends
          the packet back to <code>ovs-vswitchd</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </column>
  </table>

  <table name="Bindings" title="Physical-Logical Bindings">
    <p>
      Each row in this table identifies the physical location of a logical
      port.  Each hypervisor, via <code>ovn-controller</code>, populates this
      table with rows for the logical ports that are located on its hypervisor,
      which <code>ovn-controller</code> in turn finds out by monitoring the
      local hypervisor's Open_vSwitch database, which identifies logical ports
      via the conventions described in <code>IntegrationGuide.md</code>.

    <p>
      When a chassis shuts down gracefully, it should remove its bindings.
      (This is not critical because resources hosted on the chassis are equally
      unreachable regardless of whether their rows are present.)  To handle the
      case where a VM is shut down abruptly on one chassis, then brought up
      again on a different one, <code>ovn-controller</code> must delete any
