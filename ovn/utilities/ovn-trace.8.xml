  <h1>Name</h1>
  <p>ovn-trace -- Open Virtual Network logical network tracing utility</p>

  <h1>Synopsis</h1>
  <p><code>ovn-trace</code> [<var>options</var>] <var>datapath</var> <var>microflow</var></p>
  <p><code>ovn-trace</code> [<var>options</var>] <code>--detach</code></p>
  
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    This utility simulates packet forwarding within an OVN logical network.
    It can be used to run through ``what-if'' scenarios: if a packet
    originates at a logical port, what will happen to it and where will it
    ultimately end up?  Users already familiar with the Open vSwitch
    <code>ofproto/trace</code> command described in
    <code>ovs-vswitch</code>(8) will find <code>ovn-trace</code> to be a
    similar tool for logical networks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>ovn-trace</code> works by reading the <code>Logical_Flow</code> and
    other tables from the OVN southbound database (see
    <code>ovn-sb</code>(5)).  It simulates a packet's path through logical
    networks by repeatedly looking it up in the logical flow table, following
    the entire tree of possibilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>ovn-trace</code> simulates only the OVN logical network.  It does
    not simulate the physical elements on which the logical network is
    layered.  This means that, for example, it is unimportant how VMs are
    distributed among hypervisors, or whether their hypervisors are
    functioning and reachable, so <code>ovn-trace</code> will yield the same
    results regardless.  There is one important exception:
    <code>ovn-northd</code>, the daemon that generates the logical flows that
    <code>ovn-trace</code> simulates, treats logical ports differently based
    on whether they are up or down.  Thus, if you see surprising results,
    ensure that the ports involved in a simulation are up.
  </p>

  <p>
    The simplest way to use <code>ovn-trace</code> is to provide
    <var>datapath</var> and <var>microflow</var> arguments on the command
    line.  In this case, it simulates the behavior of a single packet and
    exits.  For an alternate usage model, see <code>Daemon Mode</code> below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <var>datapath</var> argument specifies the name of a logical
    datapath.  Acceptable names are the <code>name</code> from the northbound
    <code>Logical_Switch</code> or <code>Logical_Router</code> table, the
    UUID of a record from one of those tables, or the UUID of a record from
    the southbound <code>Datapath_Binding</code> table.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <var>microflow</var> argument describes the packet whose forwarding
    is to be simulated, in the syntax of an OVN logical expression, as
    described in <code>ovn-sb</code>(5), to express constraints.  The parser
    understands prerequisites; for example, if the expression refers to
    <code>ip4.src</code>, there is no need to explicitly state
    <code>ip4</code> or <code>eth.type == 0x800</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For reasonable L2 behavior, the microflow should include at least
    <code>inport</code> and <code>eth.dst</code>, plus <code>eth.src</code>
    if port security is enabled.  For example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    inport == "lp11" &amp;&amp; eth.src == 00:01:02:03:04:05 &amp;&amp; eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  </pre>

  <p>
    For reasonable L3 behavior, <var>microflow</var> should also include
    <code>ip4.src</code> and <code>ip4.dst</code> (or <code>ip6.src</code>
    and <code>ip6.dst</code>) and <code>ip.ttl</code>.  For example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    inport == "lp111" &amp;&amp; eth.src == f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; eth.dst == 00:00:00:00:ff:11
    &amp;&amp; ip4.src == 192.168.11.1 &amp;&amp; ip4.dst == 192.168.22.2 &amp;&amp; ip.ttl == 64
  </pre>

  <p>Here's an ARP microflow example:</p>
  <pre>
    inport == "lp123"
    &amp;&amp; eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; eth.src == f0:00:00:00:01:11
    &amp;&amp; arp.op == 1 &amp;&amp; arp.sha == f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; arp.spa == 192.168.1.11
    &amp;&amp; arp.tha == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; arp.tpa == 192.168.2.22
  </pre>

  <p>
    <code>ovn-trace</code> will reject erroneous microflow expressions, which
    beyond syntax errors fall into two categories.  First, they can be
    ambiguous.  For example, <code>tcp.src == 80</code> is ambiguous because
    it does not state IPv4 or IPv6 as the Ethernet type.  <code>ip4
    &amp;&amp; tcp.src > 1024</code> is also ambiguous because it does not
    constrain bits of <code>tcp.src</code> to particular values.  Second,
    they can be contradictory, e.g. <code>ip4 &amp;&amp; ip6</code>.
  </p>

  <h1>Output</h1>

  <p>
    <code>ovn-trace</code> supports the three different forms of output, each
    described in a separate section below.  Regardless of the selected output
    format, <code>ovn-trace</code> starts the output with a line that shows
    the microflow being traced in OpenFlow syntax.
  </p>

  <h2>Detailed Output</h2>

  <p>
    The detailed form of output is also the default form.  This form groups
    output into sections headed up by the ingress or egress pipeline being
    traversed.  Each pipeline lists each table that was visited (by number and
    name), the <code>ovn-northd</code> source file and line number of the code
    that added the flow, the match expression and priority of the logical flow
    that was matched, and the actions that were executed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The execution of OVN logical actions naturally forms a ``control stack''
    that resembles that of a program in conventional programming languages
    such as C or Java.  Because the <code>next</code> action that calls into
    another logical flow table for a lookup is a recursive construct, OVN
    ``programs'' in practice tend to form deep control stacks that, displayed
    in the obvious way using additional indentation for each level, quickly
    use up the horizontal space on all but the widest displays.  To make
    detailed output more readable, without loss of generality,
    <code>ovn-trace</code> omits indentation for ``tail recursion,'' that is,
    when <code>next</code> is the last action in a logical flow, it does not
    indent details of the next table lookup more deeply.  Output still uses
    indentation when it is needed for clarity.
  </p>

  <p>
    OVN ``programs'' traces also tend to encounter long strings of logical
    flows with match expression <code>1</code> (which matches every packet)
    and the single action <code>next;</code>.  These are uninteresting
    and merely clutter output, so <code>ovn-trace</code> omits them
    entirely even from detailed output.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following excerpt from detailed <code>ovn-trace</code> output shows a
    section for a packet traversing the ingress pipeline of logical datapath
    <code>ls1</code> with ingress logical port <code>lp111</code>.  The
    packet matches a logical flow in table 0 (aka
    <code>ls_in_port_sec_l2</code>) with priority 50 and executes
    <code>next(1);</code> to pass to table 1.  Tables 1 through 11 are
    trivial and omitted.  In table 12 (aka <code>ls_in_l2_lkup</code>), the
    packet matches a flow with priority 50 based on its Ethernet destination
    address and the flow's actions output the packet to the
    <code>lrp11-attachement</code> logical port.
  </p>

  <pre fixed="yes">
    ingress(dp="ls1", inport="lp111")
    ---------------------------------
    0. ls_in_port_sec_l2: inport == "lp111", priority 50
    next(1);
    12. ls_in_l2_lkup: eth.dst == 00:00:00:00:ff:11, priority 50
    outport = "lrp11-attachment";
    output;
  </pre>

  <h2>Summary Output</h2>

  <p>
    Summary output includes the logical pipelines visited by a packet and the
    logical actions executed on it.  Compared to the detailed output,
    however, it removes details of tables and logical flows traversed by a
    packet.  It uses a format closer to that of a programming language and
    does not attempt to avoid indentation.  The summary output equivalent to
    the above detailed output fragment is:
  </p>

  <pre fixed="yes">
    ingress(dp="ls1", inport="lp111") {
    outport = "lrp11-attachment";
    output;
    ...
    };
  </pre>

  <h2>Minimal Output</h2>

  <p>
    Minimal output includes only actions that modify packet data (not
    including OVN registers or metadata such as <code>outport</code>) and
    <code>output</code> actions that actually deliver a packet to a logical
    port (excluding patch ports).  The operands of actions that modify packet
    data are displayed reduced to constants, e.g. <code>ip4.dst =
    reg0;</code> might be show as <code>ip4.dst = 192.168.0.1;</code> if that
    was the value actually loaded.  This yields output even simpler than the
    summary format.  (Users familiar with Open vSwitch may recognize this as
    similar in spirit to the datapath actions listed at the bottom of
    <code>ofproto/trace</code> output.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The minimal output format reflects the externally seen behavior of the
    logical networks more than it does the implementation.  This makes this
    output format the most suitable for use in regression tests, because it
    is least likely to change when logical flow tables are rearranged without
    semantic change.
  </p>

  <h1>Daemon Mode</h1>

  <p>
    If <code>ovn-trace</code> is invoked with the <code>--detach</code> option
    (see <code>Daemon Options</code>, below), it runs in the background as a
    daemon and accepts commands from <code>ovs-appctl</code> (or another
    JSON-RPC client) indefinitely.  The currently supported commands are
    described below.
  </p>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>trace</code> [<var>options</var>] <var>datapath</var> <var>microflow</var></dt>
    <dd>
      Traces <var>microflow</var> through <var>datapath</var> and replies with
      the results of the trace.  Accepts the <var>options</var> described under
      <code>Trace Options</code> below.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>exit</code></dt>
    <dd>Causes <code>ovn-trace</code> to gracefully terminate.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h1>Options</h1>
  
  <h2>Trace Options</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--detailed</code></dt>
    <dt><code>--summary</code></dt>
    <dt><code>--minimal</code></dt>
    <dd>
      These options control the form and level of detail in
      <code>ovn-trace</code> output.  If more than one of these options is
      specified, all of the selected forms are output, in the order listed
      above, each headed by a banner line.  If none of these options is
      given, <code>--detailed</code> is the default.  See
      <code>Output</code>, above, for a description of each kind of output.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>--all</code></dt>
    <dd>
      Selects all three forms of output.
