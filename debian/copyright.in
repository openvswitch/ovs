   non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
   claims:

   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
   Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display,
   perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions
   thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger

   terms of this License.

   (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:
   1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from

   modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
   Original Code with other software or devices, including but not limited
   to Modifications.
   3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

   3.1 Application of License.
   The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
   the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
   under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
   every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
   impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
   the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
   hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is
   conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The
   Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set
   out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days
   before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
   Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish
   either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from
   implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of
   Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and
   to make any such deviation and reference implementation or
   Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as
   this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your
   first customer shipment of Your Modifications.

   3.2 Required Notices.
   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
   Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
   Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
   look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
   may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
   A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
   Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
   relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
   for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
   more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so
   only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer.
   You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability
   incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.
   You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if
   the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that
   Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
   version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this
   License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
   Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in
   which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code.
   You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version
   of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which
   may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
   compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the
   Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make
   it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
   offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to
   indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the
   Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

   3.4 Larger Works.
   You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code
   not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
   Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
   requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.

   4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
   must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be
   included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set
   out in Section 3.1.

   6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

   6.1 New Versions.
   Sun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
   time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   6.2 Effect of New Versions.
   Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of the
   License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms
   of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other
   than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.

   7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF
   DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE
   IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
   YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
   CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL
   CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   8.0 TERMINATION

   8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
   such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
   sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall
   survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
   nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
   shall survive.

   8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user
   license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
   been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
   termination shall survive termination.

   9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
   DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE,
   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
   WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
   LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS

   U.S. Government: If this Software is being acquired by or on behalf of
   the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or
   subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in the

   227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DoD) acquisitions) and with 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DoD acquisitions).

   11.0 MISCELLANEOUS

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
   California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
   provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
   respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
   entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of

6.	Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT SHALL INMON OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
WHETHER RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRADEMARK, THE SOFTWARE, THE
DOCUMENTATION, THE SPECIFICATIONS, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
GOODS OR SERVICES OR FOR ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND AGAINST LICENSEE BY ANY OTHER PARTY, OR OTHER
PECUNIARY LOSS, EVEN IF INMON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR KNOWS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7.	Term and Termination.  The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date,
which shall be deemed to be the date of delivery of the Software and/or Documentation and/or
Specifications to Licensee, and shall continue indefinitely unless and until terminated by
Licensee's giving written notice of termination to InMon, or by InMon pursuant to InMon's
termination rights as set forth in Section 2.3 above.  Upon any termination of this
Agreement, Licensee shall cease exercising its license rights under this Agreement,
including the right to distribute Products that incorporate the Software or Documentation
or that implement the Specifications.  The rights and obligations contained in Sections 1,
3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

8.	General Provisions.

8.1	Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their permitted successors and permitted assigns.  InMon will have the
right to assign this Agreement without notice to Licensee.  Licensee may assign or transfer
(whether by merger, operation of law or in any other manner) any of its rights or delegate
any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of InMon, provided the
assignee assumes in writing all of Licensee's obligations hereunder.

8.2	Notices.  All notices permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by first class, registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the party specified in this Agreement or such
other address as either party may specify in writing.  Such notice shall be deemed to have
been given upon receipt.

8.3	Non-Waiver.  No term or provision hereof shall be deemed waived, and no breach
excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party claimed
to have waived or consented.  Any consent or waiver, whether express or implied, shall not
constitute a consent or waiver of, or excuse for any separate, different or subsequent
breach.

8.4	Independent Contractor.  The parties' relationship shall be solely that of
independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make
either party an agent, partner, representative or principal of the other for any purpose.

8.5	Choice of Law and Forum.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under
the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to such state's conflict of laws
principles.  The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that any
legal proceeding with respect to or arising under this Agreement shall be brought in, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California or the state courts
of the State of California for the County of San Francisco.

8.6	U.S. Government Licenses.  The Software and Documentation are considered a
"commercial item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R 2.101, or "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
48 C.F.R 12.212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its successors, and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202 of the DoD FAR Supplement and its successors.

8.7	Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable under
applicable law, then such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement and the balance
of this Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and shall be
enforceable in accordance with its terms.  The court in its discretion may substitute for
the excluded provision an enforceable provision which in economic substance reasonably
approximates the excluded provision.

8.8	Compliance With Law.  Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws and
regulations (including privacy laws and regulations) having application to or governing its
 use and/or operation of the Software and agrees to indemnify and hold InMon harmless from
and against any claims, damages, losses or obligations suffered or incurred by InMon
arising from its failure to so comply.

8.9	Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement constitutes the final, complete and
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes any previous proposals, negotiations, agreements, or arrangements, whether
verbal or written, made between the parties with respect to such subject matter.  This
Agreement shall control over any additional or conflicting terms in any of Licensee's
purchase orders or other business forms.  This Agreement may only be amended or modified
by mutual agreement of authorized representatives of the parties in writing.
