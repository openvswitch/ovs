Package: openvswitch-switchui
Architecture: any
Recommends: openvswitch-switch
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, console-tools
Description: Monitoring utility for OpenFlow switches
 The ovs-switchui utility included in this package provides a
 "front-panel display" to allow administrators to view the status of
 an OpenFlow switch at a glance.
 .
 The ezio-term utility, also included, provides a VT100-compatible
 terminal interface for EZIO3 (aka MTB-134) 16x2 LCD displays found on
 server appliances made by Portwell.  It allows ovs-switchui to work
 with such displays.

Package: openvswitch-pki
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, openvswitch-common (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Open vSwitch public key infrastructure
 openvswitch-pki provides PKI (public key infrastructure) support for
 Open vSwitch switches and controllers, reducing the risk of
 man-in-the-middle attacks on the Open vSwitch network infrastructure.

Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${perl:Depends}, openvswitch-pki (= ${binary:Version}), apache2
Description: Open vSwitch public key infrastructure (HTTP server support)
 openvswitch-pki-server provides HTTP access to the Open vSwitch PKI (public
 key infrastructure) maintained on the local machine by the
 openvswitch-pki package.  This HTTP access is needed for secure and
 convenient OpenFlow switch setup using the ovs-switch-setup program
 in the openvswitch-switch package.
