Description: Open vSwitch datapath module source - module-assistant version
 Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer, software-based, Ethernet
 virtual switch. It is designed to enable massive network automation through
 programmatic extension, while still supporting standard management interfaces
 and protocols (e.g. NetFlow, sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In
 addition, it is designed to support distribution across multiple physical
 servers similar to VMware's vNetwork distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus
 1000V.
 .
 This package provides the Open vSwitch datapath module source code
 that is needed by openvswitch-switch.  The kernel module can be built
 from it using module-assistant or make-kpkg.  README.Debian in this
 package provides further instructions.

 Once this package is installed, adding BRCOMPAT=yes in
 /etc/default/openvswitch-switch enables bridge compatibility.
