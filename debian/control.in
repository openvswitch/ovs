Package: openflow-datapath-source
Architecture: all
Depends: module-assistant, bzip2, debhelper (>= 5.0.37)
Suggests: openflow-switch
Description: Source code for OpenFlow datapath Linux module
 This package provides the OpenFlow datapath module source code that
 is needed by the kernel-based OpenFlow switch.  The kernel module can
 be built from it using module-assistant or make-kpkg.  README.Debian
 in this package provides further instructions.

Package: openflow-common
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: OpenFlow common components
 openflow-common provides components required by both openflow-switch
 and openflow-controller.
