# NETDEVS: Which network devices should the OpenFlow switch include?
#
# List the network devices that should become part of the OpenFlow
# switch, separated by spaces.  At least two devices must be selected
# for this machine to be a useful switch.  Unselecting all network
# devices will disable the OpenFlow switch entirely.
# 
# The network devices that you select should not be configured with IP
# or IPv6 addresses, even if the switch contacts the controller over
# one of the selected network devices.  This is because a running
# OpenFlow switch takes over network devices at a low level: they
# become part of the switch and cannot be used for other purposes.
#NETDEVS=""

# MODE: The OpenFlow switch has three modes that determine how it
# reaches the controller:
#
# * in-band with discovery: A single network is used for OpenFlow
#   traffic and other data traffic; that is, the switch contacts the
#   controller over one of the network devices selected as OpenFlow
#   switch ports.  The switch automatically determines the location of
#   the controller using a DHCP request with an OpenFlow-specific
#   vendor option.  This is the most common case.
# 
# * in-band: As above, but the location of the controller is manually
#   configured.
# 
# * out-of-band: OpenFlow traffic uses a network separate from the
#   data traffic that it controls.  If this is the case, the control
#   network must already be configured on a network device other than
#   one of those selected as an OpenFlow switch port in the previous
#   question.
#
# Set MODE to 'discovery', 'in-band', or 'out-of-band' for these
# respective cases.
MODE=discovery

# SWITCH_IP: In 'in-band' mode, the switch's IP address may be
# configured statically or dynamically:
# 
# * For static configuration, specify the switch's IP address as a
#   string.
# 
# * For dynamic configuration with DHCP (the most common case),
#   specify "dhcp".  Configuration with DHCP will only work reliably
#   if the network topology allows the switch to contact the DHCP
#   server before it connects to the OpenFlow controller.
#
# This setting has no effect unless MODE is set to 'in-band'.
SWITCH_IP=dhcp

# CONTROLLER: Location of controller.
# One of the following formats:
#  tcp:HOST[:PORT]         via TCP to PORT (default: 975) on HOST
#  ssl:HOST[:PORT]         via SSL to PORT (default: 976) on HOST
# The default below assumes that the controller is running locally.
# This setting has no effect when MODE is set to 'discovery'.
#CONTROLLER="tcp:127.0.0.1"

# PRIVKEY: Name of file containing switch's private key.
# Required if SSL enabled.
#PRIVKEY=/etc/openflow-switch/of0-privkey.pem

# CERT: Name of file containing certificate for private key.
# Required if SSL enabled.
#CERT=/etc/openflow-switch/of0-cert.pem

# CACERT: Name of file containing controller CA certificate.
# Required if SSL enabled.
#CACERT=/etc/openflow-switch/cacert.pem

# Additional options to pass to secchan, e.g. "--fail=open"
