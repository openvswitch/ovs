    A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
    vSwitch daemon.  The top-level configuration for the daemon is the
    <ref table="Open_vSwitch"/> table, which must have exactly one
    record.  Records in other tables are significant only when they
    can be reached directly or indirectly from the <ref
    table="Open_vSwitch"/> table.  Records that are not reachable from
    the <ref table="Open_vSwitch"/> table are automatically deleted
    from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
    ``root set'' tables noted below.

              A comma-separated list of integers, each of which represents a
              quantity of memory in kilobytes that describes the operating
              system on which Open vSwitch is running.  In respective order,
              these values are:

              One such key-value pair will exist for each running Open vSwitch
              daemon process, with <var>name</var> replaced by the daemon's
              name (e.g. <code>process_ovs-vswitchd</code>).  The value is a
              comma-separated list of integers.  The integers represent the
              following, with memory measured in kilobytes and durations in
              milliseconds:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>The process's virtual memory size.</li>
              <li>The process's resident set size.</li>
              <li>The amount of user and system CPU time consumed by the

              <li>The number of times that the process has crashed and been
              automatically restarted by the monitor.</li>

              <li>The duration for which the process has been running.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The interpretation of some of these values depends on whether the
              process was started with the <option>--monitor</option>.  If it
              was not, then the crash count will always be 0 and the two
              durations will always be the same.  If <option>--monitor</option>
              was given, then the crash count may be positive; if it is, the
              latter duration is the amount of time since the most recent crash
              and restart.
            </p>

            <p>
              There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open vSwitch's
              ``run directory'' (usually <code>/var/run/openvswitch</code>)
              whose name ends in <code>.pid</code>, whose contents are a
              process ID, and which is locked by a running process.  The
              <var>name</var> is taken from the pidfile's name.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of the above
              detail on Linux systems.  On other systems, the same key-value
              pairs will be present but the values will always be the empty

              This key-value pair is omitted if there are no local, writable

        These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and

          a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a table),
          <var>major</var> is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
          in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new column),
          <var>minor</var> is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
          cosmetically (e.g. reindenting its syntax), <var>tweak</var> is

    <p>Most commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,'' pointed to by its

      corresponds to a port on a physical Ethernet switch.  A port
      with more than one interface is a ``bonded port'' (see

          <li>An ``implicitly tagged VLAN port'' or ``access port''

    <group title="Ingress Policing">
      <p>
        These settings control ingress policing for packets received on this
        interface.  On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which
        traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual
        interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at
        which the VM is able to transmit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops
        packets received in excess of the configured rate.  Due to its
        simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective than
        egress QoS (which is configured using the <ref table="QoS"/> and <ref
        table="Queue"/> tables).
      </p>
      <p>
        Policing is currently implemented only on Linux.  The Linux
        implementation uses a simple ``token bucket'' approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The size of the bucket corresponds to <ref
          column="ingress_policing_burst"/>.  Initially the bucket is full.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to tokens) is
          compared to the number of tokens currently in the bucket.  If the
          required number of tokens are available, they are removed and the
          packet is forwarded.  Otherwise, the packet is dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with tokens at the
          rate specified by <ref column="ingress_policing_rate"/>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially
        with fragmented IP packets.  Suppose that there is enough network
        activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time.  Then this token
        bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the
        period depending on packet size and on the configured rate.  All of the
        fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a
        group.  In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments
        will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped.  IP does not provide
        any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining
        fragments.  In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what
        will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be
        retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will
        recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped
        and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do).
        Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur.

          is <code>0</code>.</p>
        <p>
          Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more forgiving,
          which is important for protocols like TCP that react severely to
          dropped packets.  The burst size should be at least the size of the
          interface's MTU.  Specifying a value that is numerically at least as
          large as 10% of <ref column="ingress_policing_rate"/> helps TCP come
          closer to achieving the full rate.

        <p><em>Please note:</em> Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that
          contains unmanaged switches.  Consider an unmanaged physical switch
          with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2,
          connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets
          into VLAN 123 on port 2.  Suppose that the end host sends a packet on
          port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2.  The Open vSwitch
          forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on
          port 2 in VLAN 123.  This reflected packet causes the unmanaged
          physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which
          correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port
          2.  Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for
          the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end
          host on port 1, disrupting connectivity.  If mirroring to a VLAN is
          desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced
          by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis.  In
          addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored
          traffic. If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn
          the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic.  If
          packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will
          be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input
          port. Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to
          correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN.  If
          Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be
          disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to <ref column="flood_vlans"/>
          in the appropriate <ref table="Bridge"/> table or tables.</p>

    <p>An OpenFlow controller.</p>

    <p>
      Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Primary controllers</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow 1.0
          specification.  Usually, a primary controller implements a network
          policy by taking charge of the switch's flow table.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open vSwitch initiates and maintains persistent connections to
          primary controllers, retrying the connection each time it fails or
          drops.  The <ref table="Bridge" column="fail_mode"/> column in the
          <ref table="Bridge"/> table applies to primary controllers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary
          controllers.  When multiple controllers are configured, Open
          vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously.  Because
          OpenFlow 1.0 does not specify how multiple controllers
          coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than
          one primary controller should be specified only if the
          controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each
          other.  (The Nicira-defined <code>NXT_ROLE</code> OpenFlow
          vendor extension may be useful for this.)
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Service controllers</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for
          occasional support and maintenance use, e.g. with
          <code>ovs-ofctl</code>.  Usually a service controller connects only
          briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch's state.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open vSwitch listens for incoming connections from service
          controllers.  The service controllers initiate and, if necessary,
          maintain the connections from their end.  The <ref table="Bridge"
          column="fail_mode"/> column in the <ref table="Bridge"/> table does
          not apply to service controllers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open vSwitch supports configuring any number of service controllers.

            OpenFlow flow table.  (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able
            to connect to the client, because it did not have a flow to enable
            it.)  This is the most common connection mode because it is not

            The control network must be configured separately, before or after
            <code>ovs-vswitchd</code> is started.
