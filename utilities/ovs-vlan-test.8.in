.SH NAME
\fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR \- check Linux drivers for problems with vlan traffic
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR [\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-server\fR] \fIcontrol_ip\fR \fIvlan_ip\fR
.so lib/common-syn.man
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR utility has some limitations, for example, it does
not use TCP in its tests. Also it does not take into account MTU to detect
potential edge cases. To overcome those limitations a new tool was
developed \- \fBovs\-test\fR. \fBovs\-test\fR is currently supported only
on Debian so, if possible try to use that on instead of \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR.
.PP
The \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR program may be used to check for problems sending
802.1Q traffic which may occur when running Open vSwitch. These problems can
occur when Open vSwitch is used to send 802.1Q traffic through physical
interfaces running certain drivers of certain Linux kernel versions. To run a
test, configure Open vSwitch to tag traffic originating from \fIvlan_ip\fR and
forward it out the target interface. Then run the \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR in
client mode connecting to an \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR server.
\fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR will display "OK" if it did not detect problems.
.PP
Some examples of the types of problems that may be encountered are:
.so utilities/ovs-vlan-bugs.man
.
.SS "Client Mode"
An \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR client may be run on a host to check for VLAN
connectivity problems.  The client must be able to establish HTTP connections
with an \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR server located at the specified \fIcontrol_ip\fR
address.  UDP traffic sourced at \fIvlan_ip\fR should be tagged and directed out
the interface whose connectivity is being tested.
.
.SS "Server Mode"
To conduct tests, an \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR server must be running on a host
known not to have VLAN connectivity problems.  The server must have a
\fIcontrol_ip\fR on a non\-VLAN network which clients can establish
connectivity with.  It must also have a \fIvlan_ip\fR address on a VLAN network
which clients will use to test their VLAN connectivity.  Multiple clients may
test against a single \fBovs\-vlan\-test\fR server concurrently.
