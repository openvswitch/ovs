  <p>
    Some tables contain a column, named <code>other_config</code>.
    This column has the same form and purpose each place that it appears,
    so we describe it here to save space later.

      <p>
        Some tables do not have <code>other_config</code> column because no

  <table name="Global" title="Top-level configuration.">

      <p>
        When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP schema, which
        is expected to be the most common case, this column should point to one
        <ref table="Physical_Switch"/> record that represents the switch
        itself.  In another possible implementation, a server or a VM presents
        a VTEP schema front-end interface to one or more physical switches,
        presumably communicating with those physical switches over a
        proprietary protocol.  In that case, this column would point to one
        <ref table="Physical_Switch"/> for each physical switch, and the set
        might change over time as the front-end server comes to represent a
        differing set of switches.

        attempts to set source node replication mode for one of the logical
        switches that the physical switch is keeping context for.  An NVC
        that observes this error should take appropriate action (for example
        reverting the logical switch to service node replication mode).
        It is recommended that an NVC be proactive and test for support of
        source node replication by using a test logical switch on vtep
        physical switch nodes and then trying to change the replication mode
        to source node on this logical switch, checking for error.  The NVC
        could remember this capability per vtep physical switch.  Using
        mixed replication modes on a given logical switch is not recommended.
        Service node replication mode is considered a basic requirement
        since it only requires sending a packet to a single transport node,
        hence it is not expected that a switch should report that service
        node mode cannot be supported.

    <group title="Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)">
      <p>
        BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
        connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
        messages. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD.
      </p>

      <p>
        BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
        rate negotiated independently in each direction.  Each endpoint
        specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
        and the rate at which it's willing to transmit them.  An endpoint
        which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
        times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
        fault.  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
        system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
        to its peer in the messages it transmits.
      </p>

      <p>
        A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
        devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data. This
        can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
        service nodes providing high availability. It also enables the NVC to
        report the health status of tunnels.
      </p>

      <p>
        In many cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
        instance. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
        faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880.  Open vSwitch
        does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode''
        features.

    <group title="Per Logical-Switch Tunnel Key">
      <p>
        Tunnel protocols tend to have a field that allows the tunnel
        to be partitioned into sub-tunnels: VXLAN has a VNI, GRE and
        STT have a key, CAPWAP has a WSI, and so on.  We call these
        generically ``tunnel keys.''  Given that one needs to use a
        tunnel key at all, there are at least two reasonable ways to
        assign their values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Per <ref table="Logical_Switch"/>+<ref table="Physical_Locator"/>
            pair.  That is, each logical switch may be assigned a different
            tunnel key on every <ref table="Physical_Locator"/>.  This model is
            especially flexible.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this model, <ref table="Physical_Locator"/> carries the tunnel
            key.  Therefore, one <ref table="Physical_Locator"/> record will
            exist for each logical switch carried at a given IP destination.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>

            key, regardless of the <ref table="Physical_Locator"/> to which the
            tunnel is addressed.  This model may ease switch implementation
            because it imposes fewer requirements on the hardware datapath.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this model, <ref table="Logical_Switch"/> carries the tunnel

        For handling L2 broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic,
        packets can be sent to all members of a logical switch referenced by
        a physical switch.  There are different modes to replicate the
        packets.  The default mode of replication is to send the traffic to
        a service node, which can be a hypervisor, server or appliance, and
        let the service node handle replication to other transport nodes
        (hypervisors or other VTEP physical switches).  This mode is called
        service node replication.  An alternate mode of replication, called
        source node replication involves the source node sending to all
        other transport nodes.  Hypervisors are always responsible for doing
        their own replication for locally attached VMs in both modes.
        Service node replication mode is the default and considered a
        basic requirement because it only requires sending the packet to
        a single transport node.

      the HSC of the MACs that will be used by remote VTEPs when they
      issue ARP requests on behalf of a distributed logical router.

      The source MAC to be used by a given VTEP.

      The <code>vxlan_over_ipv4</code> encapsulation, the only encapsulation
      defined so far, can use either tunnel key model described in the ``Per
      Logical-Switch Tunnel Key'' section in the <ref table="Logical_Switch"/>
      table.  When the tunnel key per <ref table="Logical_Switch"/> model is in
      use, the <ref table="Logical_Switch" column="tunnel_key"/> column in the
      <ref table="Logical_Switch"/> table is filled with a VNI and the <ref
      column="tunnel_key"/> column in this table is empty; in the
      key-per-tunnel model, the opposite is true.  The former model is older,
      and thus likely to be more widely supported.  See the ``Per
      Logical-Switch Tunnel Key'' section in the <ref table="Logical_Switch"/>
      table for further discussion of the model.

      Each entry in the table is a single rule to match on certain
      header fields. While there are a large number of fields that can
      be matched on, most hardware cannot match on arbitrary
      combinations of fields. It is common to match on either L2
      fields (described below in the L2 group of columns) or L3/L4 fields
      (the L3/L4 group of columns) but not both. The hardware switch
      controller may log an error if an ACL entry requires it to match
      on an incompatible mixture of fields.
