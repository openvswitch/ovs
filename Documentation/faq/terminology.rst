      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

Q: I thought Open vSwitch was a virtual Ethernet switch, but the documentation
keeps talking about bridges.  What's a bridge?

    A: In networking, the terms "bridge" and "switch" are synonyms.  Open
    vSwitch implements an Ethernet switch, which means that it is also an
    Ethernet bridge.

Q: What's a VLAN?

    A: See :doc:`vlan`.
