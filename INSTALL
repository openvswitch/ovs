       Installation Instructions for OpenFlow Reference Release

This document describes how to build, install, and execute the
reference implementation of OpenFlow.  Please send any comments to:

                      <info@openflowswitch.org>

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile the userspace programs in the OpenFlow reference
distribution, you will need the following software:

    - A make program, e.g. GNU make
      (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/).  BSD make should also work.

    - The GNU C compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/).  We generally test
      with version 4.1 or 4.2.

    - libssl, from OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/), is optional but
      recommended.  libssl is required to establish confidentiality
      and authenticity in the connections among OpenFlow switches and
      controllers.

To compile the datapath kernel module, you will additionally need:

    - A supported Linux kernel version.  Please refer to README for a
      list of supported versions.

      The OpenFlow datapath requires bridging support (CONFIG_BRIDGE)
      to be built as a kernel module.  (This is common in kernels
      provided by Linux distributions.)  The bridge module must not be
      loaded or in use.  If the bridge module is running (check with
      "lsmod | grep bridge"), you must remove it ("rmmod bridge")
      before starting the datapath.

    - The correct version of GCC for the kernel that you are building
      the module against:

        * To build a kernel module for a Linux 2.6 kernel, you need
          the same version of GCC that was used to build that kernel
          (usually version 4.0 or later).

        * To build a kernel module for a Linux 2.4 kernel, you need an
          earlier version of GCC, typically GCC 2.95, 3.3, or 3.4.

    - A kernel build directory corresponding to the Linux kernel image
      the module is to run on.  Under Debian and Ubuntu, for example,
      each linux-image package containing a kernel binary has a
      corresponding linux-headers package with the required build
      infrastructure.

Building the Code
-----------------

1. In the top source directory, configure the package by running the
   configure script.  To compile without building a kernel module, you
   can usually invoke configure without any arguments:
      % ./configure

   To build a kernel module as well as the rest of the distribution,
   pass the location of the kernel build directory as an argument.
   Use --with-l26 for Linux 2.6, --with-l24 for Linux 2.4.  For
   example, to build for a running instance of Linux 2.6:
      % ./configure --with-l26=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

   To build for a running instance of Linux 2.4:
      % ./configure --with-l24=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

   To use a specific C compiler for compiling OpenFlow user programs,
   also specify it on the configure command line, like so:
      % ./configure CC=gcc-4.2

   The configure script accepts a number of other options and honors a
   additional environment variables.  For a full list, invoke
   configure with the --help option.

2. Run make in the top source directory: 
      % make

   The following binaries will be built:

   Datapath kernel module:
      datapath/linux-2.6/openflow_mod.ko (if --with-l26 was specified)
      datapath/linux-2.4/openflow_mod.o  (if --with-l24 was specified)

   Secure channel executable:
      secchan/secchan

   Controller executable:
      controller/controller

   Datapath administration utility:
      utilities/dpctl

   Runtime logging configuration utility:
      utilities/vlogconf

3. (Optional) Run "make install" to install the executables and
   manpages into the running system, by default under /usr/local.

Installing the datapath
-----------------------

To run the module, simply insmod it:

      (Linux 2.6)
      % insmod datapath/linux-2.6/openflow_mod.ko

      (Linux 2.4)
      % insmod datapath/linux-2.4/compat24_mod.o
      % insmod datapath/linux-2.4/openflow_mod.o


Testing the datapath
--------------------

Once the OpenFlow datapath has been installed (you can verify that it is
running if it appears in lsmod's listing), you can configure it using
the dpctl command line utility.

1. Create a datapath instance.  The command below creates a datapath with
   ID 0 (see dpctl(8) for more detailed usage information).
      % dpctl adddp 0
   
  (note, while in principle openflow_mod supports multiple datapaths
  within the same host, this is rarely useful in practice)

2. Use dpctl to attach the datapath to physical interfaces on the
   machine.  Say, for example, you want to create a trivial 2-port
   switch using interfaces eth1 and eth2, you would issue the following
   commands:
      % dpctl addif 0 eth1
      % dpctl addif 0 eth2

   You can verify that the interfaces were successfully added by asking
   dpctl to print the current status of datapath 0:
      % dpctl show 0

3. (Optional) You can manually add flows to the datapath to test using
   dpctl add-flows and view them using dpctl dump-flows.  See dpctl(8)
   for more details.

4. The simplest way to test the datapath is to run the provided sample
   controller on the host machine to manage the datapath directly using
   netlink:
      % controller -v nl:0

   Once the controller is running, the datapath should operate like a
   learning Ethernet switch.  You may monitor the flows in the datapath
   flow table using "dpctl dump-flows" command.

Running the datapath with a remote controller
---------------------------------------------

1. Start the datapath and attach it to two or more physical ports as
   described in the previous section.

   Note: The current version of the secure channel and controller
   require at least one interface not be connected to the datapath
   to be functional.  This interface will be used for communication
   between the secure channel and the controller.  Future releases will
   support in-band control communication.

2. Run the controller in passive tcp mode on the host which will act as
   the controller. In the example below, the controller will bind to
   port 975 (the default) awaiting connections from secure channels. 
      % controller -v ptcp:

   (See controller(8) for more details)
   
   Make sure the machine hosting the controller is reachable by the switch.  

3. Run secchan on the datapath host to start the secure channel
   connecting the datapath to a remote controller.  (See secchan(8)
   for usage details).  The channel should be configured to connect to
   the controller's IP address on the port configured in step 2.

   If the controller is running on host 192.168.1.2 port 975 (the
   default port) and the datapath ID is 0, the secchan invocation
   would look like:
      % secchan -v nl:0 tcp:192.168.1.2

Secure operation over SSL
-------------------------

The instructions above set up OpenFlow for operation over a plaintext
TCP connection.  Production use of OpenFlow should use SSL to ensure
confidentiality and authenticity of traffic among switches and
controllers.

To use SSL with OpenFlow, you must set up a public-key infrastructure
(PKI) including a pair of certificate authorities (CAs), one for
controllers and one for switches.  If you have an established PKI,
OpenFlow can use it directly.  Otherwise, refer to "Establishing a
Public Key Infrastructure" below.

To configure the controller to listen for SSL connections on the
default port, invoke it as follows:
      % controller -v pssl: --private-key=PRIVKEY --certificate=CERT \
            --ca-cert=CACERT
where PRIVKEY is a file containing the controller's private key, CERT
is a file containing the controller CA's certificate for the
controller's public key, and CACERT is a file containing the root
certificate for the switch CA.  If, for example, your PKI was created
with the instructions below, then the invocation would look like:
      % controller -v pssl: --private-key=ctl-privkey.pem \
            --certificate=ctl-cert.pem --ca-cert=pki/switchca/cacert.pem

To configure a switch to connect to a controller running on the
default port on host 192.168.1.2 over SSL, invoke it as follows:
      % secchan -v nl:0 ssl:192.168.1.2 --private-key=PRIVKEY \
            --certificate=CERT --ca-cert=CACERT
where PRIVKEY is a file containing the switch's private key, CERT is a
file containing the switch CA's certificate for the switch's public
key, and CACERT is a file containing the root certificate for the
controller CA.  If, for example, your PKI was created with the
instructions below, then the invocation would look like:
      % secchan -v nl:0 ssl:192.168.1.2 --private-key=sc-privkey.pem \
            --certificate=sc-cert.pem --ca-cert=pki/controllerca/cacert.pem

Establishing a Public Key Infrastructure
----------------------------------------

If you do not have a PKI, the ofp-pki script included with OpenFlow
can help.  To create an initial PKI structure, invoke it as:
      % ofp-pki new-pki
which will create and populate a new directory named "pki" under the
current directory.

The pki directory contains two important subdirectories.  The
controllerca subdirectory contains controller certificate authority
related files, including the following:

    - cacert.pem: Root certificate for the controller certificate
      authority.  This file must be provided to the secchan
      program with the --ca-cert option to enable it to
      authenticate valid controllers.

    - private/cakey.pem: Private signing key for the controller
      certificate authority.  This file must be kept secret.  There is
      no need for switches or controllers to have a copy of it.

The switchca subdirectory contains switch certificate authority
related files, analogous to those in the controllerca subdirectory:

    - cacert.pem: Root certificate for the switch certificate
      authority.  This file must be provided to the controller program
      with the --ca-cert option to enable it to authenticate valid
      switches.

    - private/cakey.pem: Private signing key for the switch
      certificate authority.  This file must be kept secret.  There is
      no need for switches or controllers to have a copy of it.

After you create the initial structure, you can create keys and
certificates for switches and controllers with ofp-pki.  To create a
controller private key and certificate in files named ctl-privkey.pem
and ctl-cert.pem, for example, you could run:
      % ofp-pki req+sign ctl controller
ctl-privkey.pem and ctl-cert.pem would need to be copied to the
controller for its use at runtime (they could then be deleted from
their original locations).  The --private-key and --certificate
options of controller, respectively, would point to these files.

Analogously, to create a switch private key and certificate in files
named sc-privkey.pem and sc-cert.pem, for example, you could run:
      % ofp-pki req+sign sc switch
sc-privkey.pem and sc-cert.pem would need to be copied to the switch
for its use at runtime (they could then be deleted from their original
locations).  The --private-key and --certificate options of secchan,
respectively, would point to these files.
